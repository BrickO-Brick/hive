//! buzz-agent's own agent loop, built from goose components.
//!
//! # Who owns what
//!
//! This is the deliberate inversion of the earlier design, where the turn was
//! `goose::agents::Agent::reply` and buzz-agent only translated the resulting
//! event stream onto the ACP wire. **buzz-agent owns the loop.** goose is a
//! parts bin:
//!
//! | concern | goose API used |
//! |---|---|
//! | model call | `Provider::stream` (via `Agent::provider`) |
//! | tool surface | `Agent::list_tools` |
//! | tool execution | `Agent::dispatch_tool_call` |
//! | system prompt | `Agent::build_turn_system_prompt` → `PromptManager` |
//! | compaction | `goose::context_mgmt::{check_if_compaction_needed, compact_messages}` |
//! | conversation store | buzz's own [`crate::turn_state::TurnState`], in memory |
//!
//! Everything that decides *turn shape* stays here: round structure, the
//! `_Stop` veto, `[Reflect]` on tool failure, `[PostCompact]` re-injection,
//! steer draining, cancellation semantics, and the ACP `session/update`
//! emission.
//!
//! # Why own the loop
//!
//! `Agent::reply` bakes in goose's own turn policy — its compaction trigger,
//! its stop-hook handling, its steer drain points, its max-turns rule. Every
//! buzz-specific behaviour then has to be smuggled in around the edges
//! (see the old `run_turn`: an outer loop purely to re-enter `reply()` for the
//! `_Stop` veto, and `[Reflect]` delivered as a *steer* because the tool
//! result itself was out of reach). Driving the components directly removes
//! the smuggling: the veto is a branch, `[Reflect]` is appended to the tool
//! result where buzz-agent originally put it.
//!
//! # Round structure
//!
//! One round is: build prompt+tools → stream from the provider → persist the
//! assistant message → if it asked for tools, run them, append results, and
//! loop; otherwise the turn wants to end, at which point `_Stop` may veto it.
//!
//! Compaction is checked at the top of each round rather than mid-stream, so a
//! rewrite of history can never race a partially-consumed response.
